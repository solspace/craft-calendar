> {warning} This major version introduces editions support ('Lite' edition introduced - existing customers 'Standard' licenses become 'Pro' licenses) and requires Craft 3.4+ as well. Please ensure you have a recent database backup, and we recommend you test the update on a local/staging environment before updating your production server. [Please follow the upgrading guide available here](https://docs.solspace.com/craft/calendar/v3/setup/updating-calendar-2.html)!
